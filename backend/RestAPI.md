### Detailed Revision Notes: Difference Between REST API and SOAP API

#### 1. Introduction to Web Service Communication Protocols

*   **REST (Representational State Transfer)** and **SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)** are the two most common methods for **client-server communication** in web services.
*   They serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics: **REST is lightweight and uses standard HTTP methods**, while **SOAP is a protocol with strict rules**, often employed in complex enterprise systems.

#### 2. REST API (Representational State Transfer API)

*   **Definition**: REST is an **architectural style** for building web services.
*   **Purpose**: It is primarily used for **lightweight and stateless communication**.
*   **Operational Mechanism**: REST uses **simple HTTP methods** such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to perform operations on data resources.
*   **Key Concepts**:
    *   **Resource-Oriented**: REST uses a **URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)**, treating everything as a resource.
    *   **Stateless**: It **does not store any past data or requests** and performs independent operations. This means each request from a client to a server contains all the information needed to understand the request, and the server does not store any client context between requests.
    *   **HTTP Reliance**: It relies on standard **HTTP methods** to request various operations on resources.
    *   **Data Formats**: REST commonly works with **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)** and **XML (eXtensible Markup Language)** data formats. While it generally transports data in JSON, it doesn't enforce a message format as XML or JSON, etc..
    *   **Transport**: Primarily works over **HTTP and HTTPS**.
    *   **Design Philosophy**: Designed with **mobile devices in mind**, leading to less structured and less bulky data.

#### 3. SOAP API (Simple Object Access Protocol API)

*   **Definition**: SOAP is a **messaging protocol**.
*   **Purpose**: It allows the **exchange of structured information** without being tied to any specific platform.
*   **Usage Context**: It is mostly used for **complex systems with strict standards**, ensuring high security and reliability.
*   **Key Concepts**:
    *   **Protocol with Strict Rules**: SOAP is a protocol with **strict rules for data format and communication**.
    *   **Stateful (Potentially)**: It **manages records and maintains the state between requests**, implying it can be stateful, unlike REST.
    *   **Security Reliance**: SOAP relies on **SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)** and **WS-Security** for secured communication.
    *   **Data Format**: SOAP exclusively works with the **XML data format** to handle complex data. It transports data in standard XML format.
    *   **WSDL**: Because it is XML-based and relies on SOAP, it works with **WSDL (Web Services Description Language)**.
    *   **Transport**: Works over various protocols including **HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), and XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol)**.
    *   **Design Philosophy**: Designed with **large enterprise applications in mind**, often requiring highly structured and typed data.

#### 4. Key Differences Between SOAP API and REST API

The following table highlights the core distinctions between SOAP and REST APIs:

| Feature                 | SOAP API                                                                                                  | REST API                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| :---------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Foundation**          | Relies on **SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)**, which is a protocol.                                  | Relies on **REST (Representational State Transfer) architecture**, primarily using HTTP.                                                                                                                         |
| **Data Format**         | Transports data in **standard XML format**. Works exclusively with XML to handle complex data. | Generally transports data in **JSON**. Does not enforce message format as XML or JSON etc.. Also works with XML.                                                                                             |
| **Addressing**          | Not explicitly defined by URI in the same way as REST. Relies on WSDL for service description.        | Is based on **URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)**, where everything is considered a resource.                                                                                                              |
| **Statefulness**        | Manages records and **maintains state between requests**.                                             | Follows a **stateless model**, meaning it does not store any past data or requests and performs independent operations.                                                                                      |
| **Methods**             | Works with **WSDL** (Web Services Description Language).                                              | Works with standard **HTTP methods**: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.                                                                                                                                                |
| **Protocols Used**      | Works over HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP, XMPP.                                                                   | Works over **HTTP and HTTPS**.                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| **Design Focus**        | Designed with **large enterprise applications in mind**.                                              | Designed with **mobile devices in mind**.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Security Mechanism**  | Relies on **SSL and WS-Security** for secured communication.                                          | Relies on **HTTPS** for secured communication.                                                                                                                                                                  |
