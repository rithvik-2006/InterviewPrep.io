### Detailed Revision Notes: Difference between http:// and https://

#### 1. Introduction to HTTP and HTTPS Protocols

*   When browsing the web, URLs begin with either **'http://'** or **'https://'**.
*   These prefixes indicate **how data is transmitted** between your web browser and the website you are accessing.
*   Both HTTP and HTTPS are **communication protocols**, but they differ significantly, primarily in terms of **security**.
*   This article defines both protocols, their features, and explains why HTTPS is now more frequently used.

#### 2. What is HTTP?

*   **HTTP** stands for **HyperText Transfer Protocol**.
*   It was **invented by Tim Berner**.
*   **HyperText** refers to text that is specially coded using a standard coding language, typically **HyperText Markup Language (HTML)**.
*   **Purpose**: HTTP establishes a **standard set of rules** for communication between a **web browser and a web server**. It governs the transfer of data such as text, images, and other multimedia files on the World Wide Web.
*   Users **indirectly use HTTP** whenever they open their web browser.
*   It is an **application protocol** used for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems.

##### Characteristics of HTTP
*   HTTP is an **IP-based communication protocol** that facilitates the delivery of data between a server and a client (or vice-versa).
*   It can **exchange any type of content**, provided both the server and client are compatible with it.
*   It operates as a **request and response protocol**, based on the client's and server's needs.

##### HTTP Request
*   An HTTP request is a message sent by a **client** (usually a web browser) to a **server**, demanding specific resources.
*   It comprises several elements:
    *   The **request method** (e.g., GET, POST).
    *   **Headers**.
    *   An optional **body** carrying data.
*   This is the part where the client outlines its request to the server.

##### HTTP Response
*   An HTTP response is a message sent by the **server** to the client, in answer to an HTTP request.
*   It typically contains:
    *   A **status code** describing the result of the request.
    *   **Headers** providing information about the response.
    *   The **body**, which contains the actual requested data or an error message.

##### How Does the HTTP Protocol Work?
*   The HTTP protocol uses a **request and response operational mode**.
*   When a client wants to retrieve information, it sends an **HTTP request** to the server.
*   The server receives this request and, in the form of an **HTTP response**, returns the requested data or an error message.
*   This communication takes place over the internet, using **port 80 by default**.
*   It is often referred to as the "http" or "hip protocol".

#### 3. What is HTTPS?

*   **HTTPS** stands for **HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure**.
*   It is a **combination of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol with the SSL/TLS convention** (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security protocol).
*   **Purpose**: To provide **encrypted communication and secure identification** of an arranged web server.
*   **Security**: HTTPS is **more secure than HTTP** because it is certified by **SSL (Secure Socket Layer)**. Websites with a "http://" URL are considered **not secure**.
*   **Relationship to HTTP**: **HTTPS = HTTP + Cryptographic Protocols (SSL/TLS)**.

##### Characteristics of HTTPS
*   HTTPS **encrypts all message content**, including HTTP headers and the request/response data.
*   Its **authentication aspect** requires a **trusted third party to sign server-side digital certificates**.
*   HTTPS is now used more frequently than non-secure HTTP, primarily to **ensure page genuineness**, secure user accounts, and protect client communications on all types of websites.

##### How Does the HTTPS Protocol Work?
*   HTTPS functions similarly to HTTP but adds a crucial layer of security.
*   It first establishes a **secure connection between the client and server over SSL/TLS**. This enhances security by encrypting the communication between them.
*   When a client requests a resource using HTTPS, the server and client **agree on the encryption keys** that will be used for all data transmitted during that specific session.
*   This process ensures that the **data exchanged is encrypted and coded**, making it extremely difficult to intercept and read by unauthorized parties.

#### 4. Key Differences Between HTTP and HTTPS

The main differences between HTTP and HTTPS are summarized below:

| Feature                 | HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)                                                                    | HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure)                                                                                                                                                                          |
| :---------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Full Form**           | HyperText Transfer Protocol                                                                       | HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **URL Prefix**          | Begins with "http://"                                                                             | Starts with "https://"                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Port Number**         | Uses **port 80** for communication.                                                            | Uses **port 443** for communication.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Security**            | Data (hypertext) is exchanged as **plain text**, making it relatively easy for anyone to intercept and read if the exchange is intercepted. This makes it **insecure**. | Considered **secure** because data is encrypted. However, this comes at the cost of processing time as the Web Server and Web Browser need to **exchange encryption keys using Certificates** before actual data transfer. |
| **OSI Layer**           | Works at the **Application Layer**.                                                               | Works at the **Transport Layer** (due to SSL/TLS operating below the application layer).                                                                                                                      |
| **Encryption**          | **Does not use encryption**, resulting in low security.                                           | **Uses encryption** (via SSL/TLS), providing better security.                                                                                                                                             |
| **Speed**               | Generally **faster** than HTTPS.                                                                  | Generally **slower** than HTTP due to the encryption/decryption overhead and key exchange.                                                                                                                      |
| **Data Integrity**      | Does not use data hashtags or mechanisms to secure data integrity during transmission.            | Will use cryptographic methods (like hashing) to ensure data integrity before sending and restore it on the receiver side.                                                                                      |
| **Primary Use**         | Used to transfer text, video, and images via web pages, especially for **non-sensitive information**. | Used to **transfer data securely** via a network, crucial for **online transactions and user information**.                                                                                                  |

#### 5. Conclusion and Future Outlook

*   Both HTTP and HTTPS are essential protocols for transferring data on the web.
*   **HTTPS is inherently more secure** due to its encryption and authentication mechanisms.
*   While HTTP is suitable for delivering non-sensitive information, **HTTPS is vital for securing online transactions and sensitive user data**.
*   With the emergence of new technologies and increasing security concerns, **HTTPS is expected to become the standard for secure browsing**.
