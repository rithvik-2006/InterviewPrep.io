Chapter 10, as presented in your sources, covers two distinct topics. In "Cormen Introduction to Algorithms.pdf", Chapter 10 is titled **"Elementary Data Structures"**, focusing on stacks, queues, linked lists, and basic tree representations. Conversely, in "DataStructuresCourse.pdf", Chapter 10 is dedicated to **"Binary Trees"**, including Binary Search Trees and an introduction to Red-Black Trees.

I will provide detailed revision notes for both interpretations of Chapter 10, along with pseudocode where applicable, following the conventions established in "Cormen Introduction to Algorithms.pdf".

### Chapter 10: Elementary Data Structures (from "Cormen Introduction to Algorithms.pdf")

This chapter introduces fundamental linear and hierarchical data structures that serve as building blocks for more complex algorithms. It also touches upon how to abstractly implement pointers and objects.

#### 1. Stacks and Queues (10.1)

This section describes basic dynamic sets with restrictive access patterns. Both are typically implemented using arrays or linked lists.

*   **Stacks**:
    *   **Definition**: A **Last-In, First-Out (LIFO)** data structure. Imagine a stack of plates where you can only add or remove from the top.
    *   **Operations**:
        *   **`STACK-EMPTY(S)`**: Checks if the stack `S` is empty.
        *   **`PUSH(S, x)`**: Adds item `x` to the top of the stack.
        *   **`POP(S)`**: Removes and returns the top item from the stack. Includes "underflow" error checking if empty.
    *   **Time Complexity**: All three stack operations (`STACK-EMPTY`, `PUSH`, `POP`) take **O(1) time**.
    *   **Use Cases (External Information)**: Commonly used for undo/redo functionality in applications or browser history. Also important for function call management (call stack).
    *   **Pseudocode**:
        ```pseudocode
        PROCEDURE STACK-EMPTY(S)
            IF S.top == 0 THEN
                RETURN TRUE
            ELSE
                RETURN FALSE
            END IF
        END PROCEDURE

        PROCEDURE PUSH(S, x)
            S.top = S.top + 1
            S[S.top] = x
        END PROCEDURE

        PROCEDURE POP(S)
            IF STACK-EMPTY(S) THEN
                error "underflow"
            ELSE
                S.top = S.top - 1
                RETURN S[S.top + 1]
            END IF
        END PROCEDURE
        ```
        *Note*: `S.top` is an attribute indicating the top of the stack, and `S` is treated as an array.

*   **Queues**:
    *   **Definition**: A **First-In, First-Out (FIFO)** data structure. Elements are inserted at one end (tail) and removed from the other (head).
    *   **Operations**:
        *   **`ENQUEUE(Q, x)`**: Inserts element `x` at the tail of the queue.
        *   **`DEQUEUE(Q)`**: Removes and returns the element at the head of the queue.
    *   **Time Complexity**: Both queue operations (`ENQUEUE`, `DEQUEUE`) take **O(1) time**.
    *   **Pseudocode**:
        ```pseudocode
        PROCEDURE ENQUEUE(Q, x)
            Q[Q.tail] = x
            IF Q.tail == Q.length THEN // Assuming Q.length is max capacity
                Q.tail = 1
            ELSE
                Q.tail = Q.tail + 1
            END IF
        END PROCEDURE

        PROCEDURE DEQUEUE(Q)
            x = Q[Q.head]
            IF Q.head == Q.length THEN
                Q.head = 1
            ELSE
                Q.head = Q.head + 1
            END IF
            RETURN x
        END PROCEDURE
        ```
        *Note*: Error checking for underflow/overflow is typically omitted for brevity in pseudocode but should be handled in real implementations.

#### 2. Linked Lists (10.2)

Linked lists offer a flexible representation for dynamic sets, where the order of objects is determined by explicit pointers rather than memory contiguity.

*   **Structure**:
    *   **Nodes**: Each element is an object.
    *   **Attributes**: A node typically has a `key` (value), `next` (pointer to successor), and `prev` (pointer to predecessor, for doubly linked lists).
    *   **`NIL`**: A `NIL` (or `None`) pointer indicates the end of the list (for `next` of the last node) or the beginning (for `prev` of the first node).
    *   **`L:head`**: An attribute of the list structure `L` that points to the first element; `L:head == NIL` means the list is empty.
*   **Operations**:
    *   **`LIST-SEARCH(L, k)`**: Finds the first element with key `k` by linear traversal.
        *   **Time Complexity**: **O(n)** in the worst case, as it may need to traverse the entire list.
    *   **Insertion/Deletion**: Linked lists excel at **O(1)** insertion and deletion in the middle of the list, provided you have a pointer to the element before the insertion/deletion point. This avoids the O(n) shifting required by arrays.
*   **Sentinels**: Special dummy objects (e.g., `L:nil`) can be used to simplify code, particularly for circular, doubly linked lists, by eliminating special checks for `NIL` values. While they rarely reduce asymptotic time complexity, they can reduce constant factors and enhance code clarity.
    *   **Pseudocode (with Sentinel, example `LIST-INSERT0`)**:
        ```pseudocode
        PROCEDURE LIST-INSERT0(L, x) // Inserts x as the new head of the list L
            x.next = L.nil.next
            L.nil.next.prev = x
            L.nil.next = x
            x.prev = L.nil
        END PROCEDURE
        ```
        *Note*: `L.nil` is the sentinel node; `L.nil.next` points to the head, and `L.nil.prev` points to the tail.

#### 3. Implementing Pointers and Objects (10.3)

This section discusses how to simulate pointers and objects using arrays in programming environments that lack explicit support for them.

*   **Multiple-Array Representation**: Each attribute of an object is stored in its own array (e.g., `key` array, `next` array, `prev` array). A "pointer" to an object is simply an index into these arrays, where `key[x]`, `next[x]`, `prev[x]` together represent object `x`.
*   **Single-Array Representation**: A more compact approach where an object occupies a contiguous subarray within a single large array. Attributes correspond to fixed offsets within this subarray. A pointer is the starting index of the object's subarray.
*   **Free List**: A linked list of unused "slots" or object positions within the arrays, managed by `ALLOCATE-OBJECT` and `FREE-OBJECT` procedures, to efficiently handle memory allocation and deallocation for dynamic sets.

#### 4. Representing Rooted Trees (10.4)

This section covers different ways to represent trees using linked data structures.

*   **Binary Trees**: Each node has attributes `p` (parent), `left` (left child), and `right` (right child). `NIL` indicates the absence of a parent or child. The root of the tree is pointed to by `T:root`.
*   **Rooted Trees with Unbounded Branching (`left-child, right-sibling` representation)**: Instead of a fixed number of child pointers, each node stores a pointer to its `left-child` (its first child) and a pointer to its `right-sibling` (the next sibling in order). This is efficient for trees where nodes can have an arbitrary, non-constant number of children, avoiding wasted memory.

***

### Chapter 10: Binary Trees (from "DataStructuresCourse.pdf")

This chapter introduces the concept of trees as a hierarchical data structure, specifically focusing on binary trees, Binary Search Trees (BSTs), and a brief overview of self-balancing Red-Black Trees.

#### 1. General Trees

*   **Definition**: A collection of nodes, where each node can have multiple children but only **one parent**.
*   **Structure**: Nodes are linked by references, similar to linked lists, but with branching. The "root" of the tree is at the top, and the tree "grows" downwards.

#### 2. Binary Trees

*   **Definition**: A specific type of tree where each node has **at most two children**.
*   **Purpose**: They are widely used for efficiently storing and organizing data, allowing for fast searching.

#### 3. Binary Search Trees (BSTs)

A BST is a binary tree that maintains a specific ordering property to facilitate efficient searching, minimum/maximum finding, and other order-dependent operations.

*   **Binary Search Tree Property**: For any given node `x`:
    *   All keys in its **left subtree** are **less than** `x.key`.
    *   All keys in its **right subtree** are **greater than** `x.key`.
*   **`insert` Operation**:
    *   **Mechanism**: The `insert` operation is typically implemented recursively. It starts at the root and traverses down the tree, comparing the new value with the current node's value to decide whether to go left or right.
    *   **Logic**:
        *   If the tree (or current node's subtree) is empty, the new value becomes the root (or current node's value).
        *   If the value already exists (duplicates usually not allowed or handled), the operation stops.
        *   If the value is less than the current node's value, try to insert into the left child; if no left child, create one.
        *   If the value is greater than the current node's value, try to insert into the right child; if no right child, create one.
    *   **Time Complexity**: On **average, O(log n)**. This is because each comparison halves the search space, similar to binary search in a sorted array. The number of recursive calls is proportional to the tree's height.
    *   **Pseudocode (derived from course description)**:
        ```pseudocode
        CLASS BSTNode:
            PROCEDURE __init__(self, val): // Constructor for a node
                self.val = val
                self.left = NIL
                self.right = NIL
            END PROCEDURE

            PROCEDURE insert(self, val):
                // Base case: If the node itself is empty (e.g., for the initial root)
                IF self.val IS NIL THEN
                    self.val = val
                    RETURN
                END IF

                // If value already exists, do nothing (no duplicates)
                IF val == self.val THEN
                    RETURN
                END IF

                IF val < self.val THEN // Go left
                    IF self.left IS NIL THEN // No left child, create one
                        self.left = NEW BSTNode(val)
                    ELSE // Recurse on left child
                        self.left.insert(val)
                    END IF
                ELSE // val > self.val, go right
                    IF self.right IS NIL THEN // No right child, create one
                        self.right = NEW BSTNode(val)
                    ELSE // Recurse on right child
                        self.right.insert(val)
                    END IF
                END IF
            END PROCEDURE
        END CLASS
        ```
*   **`get_min` and `get_max` Operations**:
    *   **`get_min`**: To find the minimum element, start at the root and repeatedly follow the `left` child pointers until a node with no left child is found. This node holds the minimum value.
    *   **`get_max`**: Symmetrically, to find the maximum element, follow the `right` child pointers until a node with no right child is found.
    *   **Time Complexity**: Both operations take **O(log n)** on average, as they traverse a single path down the tree.
    *   **Pseudocode (derived from course description)**:
        ```pseudocode
        PROCEDURE get_min(self):
            curr = self.val // Assuming self is the root or starting node
            WHILE curr.left IS NOT NIL DO
                curr = curr.left
            END WHILE
            RETURN curr.val
        END PROCEDURE

        PROCEDURE get_max(self):
            curr = self.val // Assuming self is the root or starting node
            WHILE curr.right IS NOT NIL DO
                curr = curr.right
            END WHILE
            RETURN curr.val
        END PROCEDURE
        ```

#### 4. Red-Black Trees (RBTs)

Red-Black Trees are a type of **self-balancing Binary Search Tree** that guarantee O(log n) worst-case performance for search, insert, and delete operations. They achieve this by adhering to a strict set of properties and performing "rotations" to maintain balance after modifications.

*   **Red-Black Properties (Rules)**:
    1.  **Each node is either red or black**.
    2.  **The root is black**.
    3.  **All NIL (leaf) nodes are black**. (Often represented by a single sentinel `T:nil` in Cormen).
    4.  **If a node is red, then both its children are black**. (No two adjacent red nodes on any path).
    5.  **For each node, all simple paths from the node to descendant NIL leaves contain the same number of black nodes**. This "black-height" property ensures balance.
*   **Rotations**:
    *   The core mechanism for rebalancing the tree.
    *   **`LEFT-ROTATE(T, x)`** and **`RIGHT-ROTATE(T, y)`** are **O(1) time** operations, involving only a constant number of pointer changes.
    *   They preserve the binary-search-tree property while changing the tree's structure to balance it.
    *   **Pseudocode for `LEFT-ROTATE` (from Cormen Introduction to Algorithms.pdf)**:
        ```pseudocode
        PROCEDURE LEFT-ROTATE(T, x)
            y = x.right // set y
            x.right = y.left // turn y's left subtree into x's right subtree
            IF y.left IS NOT T.nil THEN
                y.left.p = x
            END IF
            y.p = x.p // link x's parent to y
            IF x.p == T.nil THEN
                T.root = y
            ELSE IF x == x.p.left THEN
                x.p.left = y
            ELSE
                x.p.right = y
            END IF
            y.left = x // put x on y's left
            x.p = y
        END PROCEDURE
        ```
        *Note*: `RIGHT-ROTATE` is symmetric.
*   **`fix_insert` (RB-INSERT-FIXUP)**:
    *   After a standard BST insertion (with the new node coloured red), this procedure is called to restore the red-black properties.
    *   It involves a `WHILE` loop that continues as long as the current node's parent is red (violating property 4).
    *   Inside the loop, it performs a series of recolorings and rotations (cases 1, 2, 3) to propagate the "fix" up the tree.
    *   **Time Complexity**: This process ensures that insertion remains **O(log n)** in the worst case.
    *   **Pseudocode for `fix_insert` (derived from course description and principles of Cormen's RB-INSERT-FIXUP)**:
        *Note*: This is a simplified conceptual pseudocode based on the course's discussion and aligns with the role of Cormen's `RB-INSERT-FIXUP`. A full implementation involves detailed case handling as shown in Cormen's Chapter 13.
        ```pseudocode
        PROCEDURE RB-INSERT(T, z) // z is the new node to insert, initially red
            y = T.nil
            x = T.root

            WHILE x IS NOT T.nil DO
                y = x
                IF z.key < x.key THEN
                    x = x.left
                ELSE
                    x = x.right
                END IF
            END WHILE

            z.p = y
            IF y == T.nil THEN
                T.root = z
            ELSE IF z.key < y.key THEN
                y.left = z
            ELSE
                y.right = z
            END IF

            z.left = T.nil
            z.right = T.nil
            z.color = RED // New node is always colored red initially
            RB-INSERT-FIXUP(T, z) // Call fix-up procedure
        END PROCEDURE

        PROCEDURE RB-INSERT-FIXUP(T, z) // z is the newly inserted red node
            WHILE z.p.color == RED DO // While parent is red (property 4 violation)
                IF z.p == z.p.p.left THEN // If parent is a left child
                    y = z.p.p.right // y is z's uncle
                    IF y.color == RED THEN // Case 1: z's uncle is red
                        z.p.color = BLACK
                        y.color = BLACK
                        z.p.p.color = RED
                        z = z.p.p // Move z up two levels
                    ELSE IF z == z.p.right THEN // Case 2: z's uncle is black, and z is a right child
                        z = z.p
                        LEFT-ROTATE(T, z)
                    END IF
                    // Case 3: z's uncle is black, and z is a left child
                    z.p.color = BLACK
                    z.p.p.color = RED
                    RIGHT-ROTATE(T, z.p.p)
                ELSE // If parent is a right child (symmetric to above)
                    // ... (symmetric cases for right child)
                    y = z.p.p.left // y is z's uncle
                    IF y.color == RED THEN // Case 1 symmetric
                        z.p.color = BLACK
                        y.color = BLACK
                        z.p.p.color = RED
                        z = z.p.p
                    ELSE IF z == z.p.left THEN // Case 2 symmetric
                        z = z.p
                        RIGHT-ROTATE(T, z)
                    END IF
                    // Case 3 symmetric
                    z.p.color = BLACK
                    z.p.p.color = RED
                    LEFT-ROTATE(T, z.p.p)
                END IF
            END WHILE
            T.root.color = BLACK // Ensure root is always black
        END PROCEDURE
        ```
        *Note*: This pseudocode for `RB-INSERT` and `RB-INSERT-FIXUP` directly adapts the structure and logic from Cormen's Chapter 13, which is only briefly touched upon in the `DataStructuresCourse.pdf` excerpts for Chapter 10. The `T.nil` sentinel is crucial for these operations.

*   **Balance vs. Perfect Balance**: Red-black trees are not "perfectly" balanced, meaning they don't necessarily have the minimum possible height for `n` nodes. However, they are "balanced enough" to **guarantee O(log n)** performance for all primary operations in the worst case, making them very practical for database lookups and other applications.
