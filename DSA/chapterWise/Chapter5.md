Chapter 5 of the sources covers two distinct but related areas: **Probabilistic Analysis and Randomized Algorithms** from "Cormen Introduction to Algorithms.pdf", and **Exponential Time Algorithms** from "DataStructuresCourse.pdf".

Here are detailed revision notes for Chapter 5, including pseudocode where applicable:

### Probabilistic Analysis and Randomized Algorithms

This section introduces **probabilistic analysis** and **randomized algorithms**.
*   **Probabilistic Analysis**: Used to determine an algorithm's running time in scenarios where an inherent probability distribution exists, causing the running time to vary for inputs of the same size. It can involve:
    *   Assuming inputs conform to a known probability distribution, averaging the running time over all possible inputs.
    *   The probability distribution arising from random choices made during the algorithm's execution, not from the inputs themselves.
*   **Randomized Algorithms**: Algorithms whose behaviour is influenced by both their input and random choices from a random-number generator. They can be used to:
    *   Enforce a probability distribution on inputs, preventing any specific input from consistently causing poor performance.
    *   Bound the error rate for algorithms permitted to produce incorrect results on a limited basis.

**Key Problems and Pseudocode:**

1.  **The Hiring Problem**
    *   This problem models a hiring strategy where an applicant is hired if they are better qualified than the current office assistant, necessitating firing the current one and paying a fee. The `HIRE-ASSISTANT` procedure expresses this strategy.
    *   **Pseudocode: `HIRE-ASSISTANT`** (Conceptual, as full pseudocode is not provided in the excerpt for all lines, but its existence is noted)
        ```
        PROCEDURE HIRE-ASSISTANT(n)
            // Assumes candidates are numbered 1 through n
            // Dummy candidate 0 is less qualified than others
            // (Full pseudocode not provided in source excerpt, but described as taking 'n' as parameter)
        ```
    *   **Analysis**: The expected number of hires is computed using **indicator random variables**, assuming candidates arrive in a random order.

2.  **Permuting an Array Randomly (PERMUTE-BY-SORTING)**
    *   This procedure assigns a random priority to each element in an array and then sorts the array based on these priorities, resulting in a random permutation.
    *   **Pseudocode: `PERMUTE-BY-SORTING`**
        ```
        PERMUTE-BY-SORTING(A)
        1 n = A.length
        2 let P[1..n] be a new array
        3 for i = 1 to n
        4     P[i] = RANDOM(1, n^3) // Chooses a random number between 1 and n^3
        5 sort A, using P as sort keys
        ```
    *   **Detail**: The range of 1 to n^3 for random numbers makes it likely that all priorities in `P` are unique. The probability of all elements being unique is at least 1 - 1/n.

3.  **Generating a Random Sample (RANDOM-SAMPLE)**
    *   This recursive procedure returns a random `m`-element subset `S` from a set of `n` elements, ensuring each `m`-subset is equally likely. It uses fewer calls to `RANDOM` than permuting and taking the first `m` elements.
    *   **Pseudocode: `RANDOM-SAMPLE`**
        ```
        RANDOM-SAMPLE(m, n)
        1 if m == 0
        2     return {}
        3 else S = RANDOM-SAMPLE(m - 1, n - 1)
        4     i = RANDOM(1, n)
        5     if i ∈ S
        6         S = S ∪ {n} // Add the last element (n) if i is already in S
        7     else S = S ∪ {i} // Add element i
        8     return S
        ```

### Exponential Time Algorithms

This section from the "DataStructuresCourse.pdf" introduces the concept of **polynomial time** versus **exponential time** algorithms.

*   **Polynomial Time (P)**:
    *   An algorithm runs in polynomial time if its runtime does not grow faster than n^k, where `n` is the input size and `k` is any constant (e.g., O(n), O(n log n), O(n^2), O(n^3)).
    *   Algorithms in class P are generally considered **practical to solve** on computers. The set of polynomial-time algorithms is referred to as "P".

*   **Exponential Time**:
    *   Algorithms that grow at a rate of O(2^n) or O(n!) (factorial time).
    *   These algorithms become **too slow to be practical** after a very few iterations and are almost worthless for general use.
    *   Their extremely high computational cost might be intentionally used in specific fields like **cryptography and security**. For instance, a power set of 25 items could take 9 hours, and 40 items over 34 years to compute if one subset is calculated per millisecond, not accounting for memory.

**Examples and Pseudocode:**

1.  **Fixing Fibonacci Sequence Calculation**
    *   The naive recursive solution for Fibonacci sequence calculation runs in exponential time because it repeatedly calculates the same numbers.
    *   The goal is to convert this into a **polynomial-time algorithm** (specifically, linear time, O(n)) by using a loop and maintaining state variables to avoid redundant calculations. This is also known as **memoization** or a **bottom-up dynamic programming** approach, which Cormen discusses elsewhere.
    *   **Derived Pseudocode: `POLYNOMIAL-FIB`** (Based on the detailed description)
        ```
        PROCEDURE POLYNOMIAL-FIB(n)
        1   IF n EQUALS 0 THEN
        2       RETURN 0
        3   IF n EQUALS 1 THEN
        4       RETURN 1
        5   grandparent_fib_val = 0
        6   parent_fib_val = 1
        7   FOR i FROM 2 TO n DO
        8       current_fib_val = parent_fib_val + grandparent_fib_val
        9       grandparent_fib_val = parent_fib_val
        10      parent_fib_val = current_fib_val
        11  RETURN current_fib_val
        ```
    *   **Explanation**: This iterative approach stores previously computed Fibonacci values (`parent_fib_val` and `grandparent_fib_val`) and uses them to calculate the next value (`current_fib_val`), thus avoiding the exponential recalculations of a purely recursive solution.

2.  **Power Set Calculation**
    *   The power set of a given collection contains all possible combinations of its elements. This problem inherently leads to an exponential time complexity (O(2^n)) because the output size grows exponentially with the input size `n`.
    *   **Derived Pseudocode: `POWER-SET`** (Based on the detailed description)
        ```
        PROCEDURE POWER-SET(input_list)
        1   IF LENGTH(input_list) EQUALS 0 THEN
        2       RETURN [[]] // Base case: returns a list containing one empty list (representing the empty set)
        3   
        4   first_element = input_list
        5   remaining_elements = input_list[1:] // All elements except the first
        6   
        7   subsets_of_remaining = POWER-SET(remaining_elements) // Recursive call
        8   
        9   new_subsets = []
        10  FOR each_subset IN subsets_of_remaining DO
        11      ADD (each_subset + [first_element]) TO new_subsets // Create a new subset by adding the first element
        12  
        13  RETURN subsets_of_remaining + new_subsets // Combine subsets from the recursive call with the newly created ones
        ```
    *   **Explanation**: This recursive strategy works by taking the first element, recursively finding all subsets of the rest of the list, and then combining those subsets with new subsets formed by adding the first element to each of them. The exponential growth is inherent to the problem's nature, as the output size is 2^n.
