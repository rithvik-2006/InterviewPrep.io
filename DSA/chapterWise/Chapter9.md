Chapter 9 of the provided sources covers two entirely different topics. In "Cormen Introduction to Algorithms.pdf", Chapter 9 is titled **"Medians and Order Statistics"**. In "DataStructuresCourse.pdf", Chapter 9 is titled **"Linked Lists"**. I will provide detailed revision notes for both, with pseudocode where available in the excerpts.

### Chapter 9: Medians and Order Statistics (from "Cormen Introduction to Algorithms.pdf")

This chapter focuses on **order statistics**, which involves finding the $i$-th smallest element in a set of $n$ elements. It demonstrates how to achieve linear time complexity for this problem, contrasting with the $\Theta(n \lg n)$ lower bound for comparison sorts when a sorted output is required.

#### 1. Minimum and Maximum

*   **Problem**: Finding the smallest or largest element in a set.
*   **Simple Approach**: A straightforward linear scan requires $O(n)$ comparisons.
*   **Simultaneous Min and Max**: It is possible to find both the minimum and maximum of $n$ numbers in $\Theta(n)$ time using $d3n/2e - 2$ comparisons in the worst case. This is more efficient than finding them separately.

#### 2. The General Selection Problem

*   **Problem**: Finding the $i$-th smallest element (e.g., median, quartiles) from an unordered set of $n$ elements.
*   **Key Insight**: Surprisingly, the asymptotic running time for this general problem is the same as finding the minimum or maximum: $\Theta(n)$.

#### 2.1. Selection in Expected Linear Time (RANDOMIZED-SELECT)

*   **Algorithm**: `RANDOMIZED-SELECT` is a **divide-and-conquer algorithm** modelled after the Quicksort algorithm from Chapter 7.
*   **Principle**:
    *   It partitions the input array recursively around a pivot element.
    *   Unlike Quicksort, which recursively processes both sides, `RANDOMIZED-SELECT` **recursively works on only one side of the partition**, the side that contains the $i$-th smallest element.
*   **Time Complexity**:
    *   **Expected Running Time**: **$O(n)$**. This efficiency comes from only recursing on one subproblem.
    *   **Worst-Case Running Time**: **$\Theta(n^2)$**, similar to Quicksort's worst case. This occurs with consistently bad partitions (e.g., always picking the smallest/largest element as the pivot).

*   **Pseudocode (Conceptual based on description in sources)**:
    The direct pseudocode for `RANDOMIZED-SELECT` is not provided in the given excerpts. However, based on the description that it's "modeled after the quicksort algorithm of Chapter 7" and "partitions the input array recursively" but "works on only one side of the partition", its structure can be conceptualized:

    ```pseudocode
    PROCEDURE RANDOMIZED-SELECT(A, p, r, i)
        // A: The input array (subarray A[p...r])
        // p: Starting index of the subarray
        // r: Ending index of the subarray
        // i: The rank of the desired element (i-th smallest)

        IF p == r THEN
            RETURN A[p] // Base case: single element
        END IF

        q = RANDOMIZED-PARTITION(A, p, r) // Partition around a randomly chosen pivot
        // Note: RANDOMIZED-PARTITION (from Chapter 7) returns the index of the pivot

        k = q - p + 1 // k is the number of elements in the low side of the partition plus the pivot itself

        IF i == k THEN
            RETURN A[q] // The pivot is the i-th smallest element
        ELSE IF i < k THEN
            RETURN RANDOMIZED-SELECT(A, p, q - 1, i) // Recurse on the left subarray
        ELSE // i > k
            RETURN RANDOMIZED-SELECT(A, q + 1, r, i - k) // Recurse on the right subarray, adjusting rank
        END IF
    END PROCEDURE
    ```
    *Note*: `RANDOMIZED-PARTITION` would be a subroutine, and its detailed pseudocode is typically found in Chapter 7.

#### 2.2. Selection in Worst-Case Linear Time (SELECT)

*   **Algorithm**: `SELECT` is a more complex algorithm that guarantees **$O(n)$ worst-case running time**.
*   **Principle**: It achieves its worst-case linear time by ensuring that the partitions are always "good enough." It does this by:
    1.  **Dividing the $n$ elements into groups of 5** (or some constant size like 7, but not 3 for linear time).
    2.  Finding the **median of each group**.
    3.  Recursively finding the **median of these medians** (this median-of-medians is used as the pivot).
    4.  Partitioning the original array around this median-of-medians.
    5.  Recursively calling `SELECT` on the appropriate partition.
*   **Guarantee**: If $n \ge 140$, at least $dn/4e$ elements are greater than the median-of-medians $x$ and at least $dn/4e$ elements are less than $x$, ensuring balanced recursion.
*   **Pseudocode**: The detailed pseudocode for `SELECT` is **not provided** in the given excerpts, only its conceptual steps and analytical properties.

### Chapter 9: Linked Lists (from "DataStructuresCourse.pdf")

This chapter introduces **linked lists** as a fundamental data structure, contrasting their memory management and operational characteristics with arrays (or "regular lists" in Python).

#### 1. What is a Linked List?

*   **Definition**: A linked list is an **ordered collection of items**.
*   **Structure**: Unlike arrays that store data contiguously in memory, linked lists store elements (called **nodes**) at potentially **different places in memory**.
*   **Connection**: Nodes are connected to each other through **references** (pointers). Each node contains a `val` (the actual value) and a `next` (a reference to the subsequent node).
*   **End of List**: The `next` field of the last node is typically `None` (or `NIL` in general pseudocode) to indicate the end of the list.

#### 2. Node Implementation

Each element in a linked list is represented by a `Node` object.

*   **`Node` Constructor**: Initializes a new node with a given `val` and sets its `next` pointer to `None` by default.
*   **`set_next` Method**: Allows linking one node to another by updating its `next` field.

*   **Pseudocode for `Node` class**:
    ```pseudocode
    CLASS Node:
        PROCEDURE __init__(self, val):
            self.val = val
            self.next = None // Initially, no next node
        END PROCEDURE

        PROCEDURE set_next(self, node):
            self.next = node // Sets the next node in the list
        END PROCEDURE
    END CLASS
    ```

#### 3. Operations and Performance Characteristics

Linked lists offer different performance trade-offs compared to array-backed lists.

*   **Insertion/Deletion in the Middle**:
    *   **Advantage**: This is a key strength of linked lists. Inserting a new node or deleting an existing node in the middle of a linked list can be done in **O(1) time**.
    *   **Mechanism**: It only requires updating **two references**: the `next` pointer of the preceding node to point to the new/next node, and the `next` pointer of the new node (for insertion) to point to the subsequent node. This avoids the need to shift all subsequent elements, which is an O(n) operation for arrays.
*   **Iteration (Traversing the List)**:
    *   **Asymptotic Complexity**: Iterating through all nodes is still **O(n)**, as each node must be visited.
    *   **Practical Performance**: In practice, iterating through linked lists can be **slower** than arrays. This is because array elements are contiguous in memory, allowing for more efficient CPU cache usage, whereas linked list nodes can be scattered, leading to more memory access overhead.
*   **Access by Index (e.g., `list`)**:
    *   **Disadvantage**: Directly accessing an element by its numerical index is **not efficient** and is "basically impossible" by default.
    *   **Mechanism**: To find the $k$-th element, one must traverse from the beginning of the list, following `next` pointers $k$ times, resulting in an **O(k)** or **O(n)** worst-case operation.

#### 4. Use Cases and General Advice

*   **Use Cases**: Linked lists are particularly useful in specific situations where **frequent insertions or deletions in the middle of the list** are required, such as implementing queues efficiently (where elements are inserted at one end and removed from the other). They are also used in other data structures like graphs and trees as the underlying representation.
*   **General Recommendation**: For most day-to-day programming (e.g., in Python), **regular lists (arrays)** are generally more convenient, often faster (due to system optimizations for contiguous memory access), and easier to use. It is advised to "benchmark" and run tests to see if a linked list actually provides the desired performance gains in a real-world scenario.
