### 1. Data Structures Introduction (from "DataStructuresCourse.pdf" Chapter 6)

This section provides a general overview of data structures and their fundamental role in computing.

*   **Definition and Relationship with Algorithms**
    *   A **data structure** is essentially a mechanism used to organise and store data, enabling efficient access and modification.
    *   Data structures inherently rely on algorithms for their implementation, while simultaneously serving as foundational components for other algorithms. This creates a close intertwinement between the two concepts.
    *   A data structure stores data, organises it for easy access and modification, and contains algorithmic functions to expose abilities to read and modify the data.

*   **Built-in Data Structures and Their Operations**
    *   Programming languages often include **built-in data structures** such as lists (arrays) and dictionaries (hashmaps). These come with pre-implemented logic for their operations.
    *   **Lists (Arrays)**:
        *   **Append**: Adding an item to the end of a list is, on average, an **O(1) operation**.
        *   **Indexing**: Accessing an item by its index is an **O(1) lookup**.
        *   **Deleting**: Removing an element from the middle of a list is typically an **O(N) operation** because subsequent elements need to be shifted.
        *   **Searching**: Iterating through a list to find a specific value is an **O(N) operation** in the worst case, as lists are not necessarily ordered by value.
    *   **Maximal Edges in Graphs**: A graph with `n` vertices can have at most `n * (n - 1) / 2` edges. This is slightly less than half of `n^2`. For example:
        *   2 vertices: 1 edge
        *   3 vertices: 3 edges
        *   4 vertices: 6 edges
        *   6 vertices: 15 edges
    *   **Adjacency List for Graphs**: An adjacency list typically represents a graph as a **dictionary where keys are vertices and values are sets of connected vertices**. This structure is useful for representing the absence of an edge, as nodes not sharing an edge will simply not be referenced in the set.

*   **Example Pseudocode: `count_marketers`**
    This function counts the occurrences of a specific job title ("marketer") in a list of job titles, accounting for different casing by converting to lowercase.

    ```
    PROCEDURE count_marketers(job_titles)
        count = 0
        FOR job_title IN job_titles DO
            IF job_title.lower() == "marketer" THEN
                count = count + 1
            END IF
        END FOR
        RETURN count
    END PROCEDURE
    ```

### 2. Heapsort and Heap Data Structure (from "Cormen Introduction to Algorithms.pdf" Chapter 6)

This section introduces **Heapsort**, an efficient sorting algorithm, and the **Heap data structure**, which is fundamental to its operation and other applications like priority queues.

*   **Heapsort Algorithm Overview**
    *   Heapsort is a sorting algorithm with a worst-case running time of **O(n lg n)**.
    *   Unlike merge sort, but similar to insertion sort, heapsort is an **in-place sorting algorithm**, meaning it uses only a constant amount of additional memory.
    *   It utilises a data structure called a **"heap"** to manage information during the sorting process.

*   **The Heap Data Structure**
    *   A heap is a specific type of binary tree that satisfies the **heap property**: for a **max-heap**, the key of each node is greater than or equal to the keys of its children.
    *   Heaps are particularly useful for implementing **priority queues**. Priority queues allow efficient insertion of elements and extraction of the minimum/maximum element.

*   **Key Procedures for Heap Management**
    The following procedures are central to working with heaps. While their full pseudocode is not provided in the given excerpts, their functionalities and performance characteristics are described.

    1.  **`MAX-HEAPIFY`**
        *   **Purpose**: This procedure is used to maintain the max-heap property. It assumes that the children of a given node `i` are already max-heaps, but that `A[i]` might be smaller than its children, violating the max-heap property. `MAX-HEAPIFY` corrects this violation by letting `A[i]` "float down" in the heap until the property is restored.
        *   **Running Time**: It runs in **O(h)** time, where `h` is the height of the node `i` in the heap. For an `n`-element heap, this is **O(lg n)**.

    2.  **`BUILD-MAX-HEAP`**
        *   **Purpose**: This procedure converts an arbitrary array `A` into a max-heap.
        *   **Method**: It works in a **bottom-up manner**, iterating through the non-leaf nodes of the tree and calling `MAX-HEAPIFY` on each one. This ensures that when `MAX-HEAPIFY` is called on a node, its subtrees are already max-heaps.

    3.  **`HEAPSORT`**
        *   **Purpose**: To sort an array in place using the heap data structure.
        *   **Method**:
            *   First, it calls `BUILD-MAX-HEAP` on the input array `A` to construct a max-heap.
            *   Then, it repeatedly extracts the maximum element (which is always at the root, `A`) and places it into its correct sorted position at the end of the array. After each extraction, it calls `MAX-HEAPIFY` on the root of the remaining heap to restore the heap property.

*   **Priority Queue Operations (using Heaps)**
    Heaps are used to implement **max-priority queues** and **min-priority queues**. Common operations include:
    *   **`HEAP-MINIMUM`**: Returns the element with the largest key (for a max-heap).
    *   **`HEAP-EXTRACT-MIN`**: Removes and returns the element with the largest key (for a max-heap).
    *   **`HEAP-INCREASE-KEY`**: Increases the value of an element's key and adjusts its position in the heap (e.g., by "bubbling up").
    *   **`MIN-HEAP-INSERT`**: Inserts a new element into a min-heap.
    *   **`HEAP-DELETE`**: Deletes an item from a heap.

*   **Pseudocode: `BUILD-MAX-HEAP0` (Alternative Heap Construction)**
    This is an alternative method for building a max-heap by repeatedly inserting elements using `MAX-HEAP-INSERT`.

    ```
    PROCEDURE BUILD-MAX-HEAP0(A)
        A.heap-size = 1
        FOR i = 2 TO A.length DO
            MAX-HEAP-INSERT(A, A[i])
        END FOR
    END PROCEDURE
    ```
    **Note**: This `BUILD-MAX-HEAP0` procedure is shown to require **O(n lg n)** time in the worst case, in contrast to the more efficient `BUILD-MAX-HEAP` (which is described but not fully pseudocoded in the provided excerpts).
