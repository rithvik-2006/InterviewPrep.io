Here are detailed revision notes on Chapter 1 of the sources, focusing on the fundamental concepts of algorithms and including pseudocode examples where relevant:

### Chapter 1: Introduction to Algorithms

Chapter 1 serves as a foundational overview, introducing what algorithms are, their significance in computing, and how they are studied and described. It aims to help you **think algorithmically**, understand **performance optimisation**, and **practice solving hard problems**. The chapter emphasizes understanding *how* algorithms work rather than memorising their code.

#### 1. What is an Algorithm?
*   An **algorithm** is fundamentally a **set of instructions that can be carried out to solve a problem**.
*   In the context of computer science, it is a **finite sequence of well-defined, computer-implementable instructions**.
*   Algorithms existed even before computers, but they are now at the **heart of computing**. The term "algorithm" itself is derived from "al-Khowârizmı̂," a ninth-century Persian mathematician.

#### 2. Key Properties of an Algorithm
For an algorithm to be effective and implementable, it must possess several crucial properties:
*   **Defined**: There must be a **specific, unambiguous sequence of steps** that can be taken to perform the task.
*   **Unambiguous**: An implementation of the algorithm should not be open to interpretation; it is either correct or incorrect.
*   **Implementable**: The algorithm must be capable of being carried out, most commonly with software.
*   **Finite**: An algorithm must consist of a **finite number of steps**.

#### 3. The Importance and Role of Algorithms
*   **Performance Implications**: Understanding algorithms helps developers understand the **performance implications** of the code they write, as users consistently demand fast applications.
*   **Problem Solving**: Learning algorithms provides **practice in solving hard problems**, which is a crucial skill for any developer.
*   **Technology**: Algorithms are considered a **technology** alongside other computing technologies such as fast hardware, graphical user interfaces, and networks. The goal is to write **fast algorithms** by considering how their execution speed changes with increasing input size.

#### 4. Describing and Analysing Algorithms
*   Algorithms are typically described using **English** and **pseudocode**.
*   **Pseudocode** is a high-level, language-agnostic description of a solution. It is often written in plain English, abstracting away the idiosyncrasies of specific programming languages (like Python, C, Java, or Pascal) to convey the essence of the algorithm clearly and concisely.
*   **Efficiency** is a key design criterion, and algorithms are often analysed based on their **running times**. Big-O analysis is introduced later (Chapter 3) as a method to categorise algorithms by how their performance (especially worst-case runtime) scales with input size.

##### Pseudocode Conventions (from the Cormen source):
While general pseudocode can be plain English, the "Introduction to Algorithms" text uses specific conventions for clarity:
*   **Assignment**: Uses the symbol `D` (e.g., `x D y`).
*   **Equality Test**: Uses `==` (e.g., `x == y`).
*   **Comments**: Indicated by `//`.
*   **Block Structure**: Indentation defines block structure (e.g., for loops, while loops, if-else statements).
*   **Object Attributes**: Uses dot-notation (e.g., `A:length` to denote the number of elements in array `A`).
*   **Arrays**: Elements accessed using square brackets (e.g., `A[i]`), and subarrays denoted with `::` (e.g., `A[1::j]`).
*   **Variables**: Typically local to the given procedure unless explicitly indicated as global.
*   **Boolean Operators**: `and` and `or` are short-circuiting.

#### 5. Examples of Algorithms (from Chapter 1 context)

Although the "Cormen Introduction to Algorithms" book primarily presents detailed pseudocode for algorithms starting from Chapter 2 (e.g., Insertion Sort), the "DataStructuresCourse.pdf" introduces simple examples of algorithms in its Chapter 1.

*   **`find_minimum` Algorithm**:
    This algorithm finds the lowest follower count in a list of influencer accounts. It demonstrates handling edge cases (like an empty input list) and iterating through data to find a specific value.

    **Pseudocode Example:**
    ```pseudocode
    find_minimum(nums):
        if length(nums) == 0:
            return NIL // Handles the edge case of an empty list
        
        min_val D positive_infinity // Initialise with a value greater than any possible number
        
        for each num in nums:
            if num < min_val:
                min_val D num // Update min_val if a smaller number is found
        
        return min_val
    ```
   

*   **Longest String in a List**:
    This algorithm (described conceptually) maintains a variable for the longest string found so far, iterates through all input strings, and updates the "longest so far" if a longer string is encountered.

*   **Adding Two Numbers**:
    A very simple algorithm that takes two input variables, adds them using an operator, assigns the result to a sum variable, and returns the sum.

*   **Mystery Algorithm (Reverses a String)**:
    This algorithm (described conceptually) starts with an original string (`S`) and an empty string (`R`). It then loops through `S` from its last character to its first, adding each character to the end of `R`. The result is `R` containing the reversed string.
